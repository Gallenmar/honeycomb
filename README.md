# HoneyComb Codebase

## 🐝 Story

Searching for a new home shouldn’t feel like running a marathon through a maze of half-baked listings and confusing interfaces. Yet too often, you’re left:

- Clicking through endless, poorly organized pages  
- Squinting at grainy photos and generic blurbs  
- Juggling a dozen browser tabs just to compare your favorites  
- Chasing down contact info and coordinating viewings—only to discover the place doesn’t match the pictures

We asked ourselves: Why is finding a home still stuck in the Stone Age? What if we could inject a little intelligence into every step of the journey—especially on popular public marketplaces like SS.LV? What if your next property search felt less like paperwork… and more like an inspired treasure hunt?

Enter **HoneyComb**: your AI-powered real estate companion designed to bring clarity, consistency, and a touch of delight to every listing.
